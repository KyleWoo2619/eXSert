  diaryDescription: "My intel was correct. I have found and boarded this behemoth
    of a ship that has terrorized our city for so long. How a ship put together this
    haphazardly is able to fly is beyond me. I was able to sneak aboard while the
    ship refueled and am now committed to blowing it out of the sky for good. If
    I fail, I\u2019ll at least know I gave it everything I could.. Hopefully I will
    be able to do this stealthily and without alerting The Cleanser.\r\n"
