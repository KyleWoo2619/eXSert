  diaryDescription: "Getting on the ship may have been easy, but the Cleanser is
    definitely aware of my presence now. I ran into several patrols in the ship\u2019s
    cargo bay, they must have started searching for me the moment I boarded. I\u2019m
    glad my gauntlets remain in good fighting condition or I would not be able to
    fend off the unyielding hoards. I can only hope that I\u2019ll have enough stamina
    to face the Cleanser once I find him."
