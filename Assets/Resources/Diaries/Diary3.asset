  diaryDescription: "I\u2019ve been finding notes throughout the ship. Some are tucked
    away and some are just out in the open. I\u2019m gaining several insights on
    the complex machinations of the Cleanser\u2019s mind. It makes some points that
    do make me feel sorry for the way it was treated in this world, but I must remain
    vigilant in my mission. The world is depending on me."
