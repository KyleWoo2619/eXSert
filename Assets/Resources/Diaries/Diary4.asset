  diaryDescription: "As I explored the crew quarters I couldn\u2019t help but imagine
    what it was like when it was part of its original aircraft. It felt\u2026 hauntingly
    empty and devoid of life. The robots have no need for personal quarters so the
    only effects I found were those left behind by the people who once inhabited
    this ship.Well, those and the occasional notes that must have been left by the
    Cleanser as he built this place."
