  diaryDescription: "I am left breathless after having to jump and climb my way through
    the hangar. I can\u2019t help but wonder what plans have been made for the aircrafts
    in there. I can only imagine the damage they could bring to the human race. The
    Cleanser seems to have a fascination with flight\u2013 It shows in his notes
    and the immense care that has been put into the planes along with the ship itself."
