  diaryDescription: "The conservatory was surprisingly beautiful and full of life.
    I can\u2019t fathom what any form of robot would get out of something like that.
    In the logs I\u2019ve found the Cleanser has expressed a fascination with flight
    and birds, but I can\u2019t seem to figure out why it was willing to give up
    so much space on a warcraft for something like that. There were obviously experiments
    of some kind being run in the labs surrounding the Conservatory. I wonder what
    the Cleanser is thinking."
