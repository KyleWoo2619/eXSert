    Specialized unlockable interaction for puzzles.
    Place this script where you want a puzzle to be interacted with and activated by the player.
    Don't forget to assign the puzzle script that implements IPuzzleInterface in the inspector!
    Remember this should be placed where you want the player to START the puzzle from; not necessarily where the puzzle itself is located.

        - Added ButtonPressed event to allow for more flexible puzzle interactions
